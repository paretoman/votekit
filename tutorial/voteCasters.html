        <p>VoteCasters: Votes are cast.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parent Page: <a href="/votekit/tutorial/election.html">Election</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="votecasters">VoteCasters</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Voter geometries cast their votes.</li>
  <li>A density of a population of voters is summed. A 1D or 2D spatial model is used to make the decision of how to vote or who to vote for.</li>
  <li>The vote is aggregated into a set that contains the information needed to elect, explain, and visualize.</li>
  <li>There are two ways to cast.
    <ol>
      <li>By points.</li>
      <li>By regions. This is more complicated.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The “votes” output data structure is described below. You can skip to that part.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>

<h3 id="a-single-preference">A single Preference</h3>

<p>: also called a single vote.</p>

<p>These are the three ways to state a preference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plurality: a choice of a candidate.</li>
  <li>Scores: a score for each candidate.</li>
  <li>Ranking: a rank for each candidate.</li>
</ul>

<p>A preference is stored as data in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plurality
    <ul>
      <li>pluralityVote: the chosen candidate.
        <ul>
          <li>A candidate is represented as an integer from 0 to a max. The max is the number of candidates minus 1.</li>
          <li>type: Number</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scores
    <ul>
      <li>scoreVote: an array of scores, indexed by candidate.
        <ul>
          <li>A score is a number between 0 and 1. In the future, maybe integers between 0 and a maximum score.</li>
          <li>type: Number[], Number array</li>
          <li>length: number of candidates</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ranking
    <ul>
      <li>ranking: an array of ranks, indexed by candidate.
        <ul>
          <li>A rank of 0 is the best ranking, then 1, 2, and so on. No rankings are skipped, but skipping is allowed. Equal ranks are allowed.</li>
          <li>type: Number[], Number array</li>
          <li>length: number of candidates</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>cansByRank: an array of candidates lists, indexed by rank. Candidates can share a rank. Number[][]..</li>
      <li>indexInOrder: an array of candidates in order of rank. Only one candidate is listed per rank. Number[].</li>
      <li>netWinsPairwise: The number of wins minus number of losses for the first of a pair of candidates. Number[][]</li>
      <li>bordaScores: The borda scores for each candidate for one vote. Number[]</li>
      <li>bordaFractions: Fractional borda scores, between 0 and 1. Number[]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="preference-lists">Preference Lists</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Plurality
    <ul>
      <li>There is no “pluralityVotes” list of preferences because it isn’t needed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scores
    <ul>
      <li>scoreVotes: a list of scoreVote preferences, Number[][]. Each preference has a score for each candidate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ranking
    <ul>
      <li>rankings: a list of preferences. Each preference has a rank for each candidate. Number[][]. 0 is the best ranking, then 1, 2, etc.</li>
      <li>cansByRankList: a list of preferences. Each preference is a list indexed by rank. Each entry is a list of candidates at that ranking. Candidates are represented by index. Number[][][].</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="counting">Counting</h2>

<p>Ways to say how many votes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>area: number of pixels.</li>
  <li>density: votes per pixel. From 0 to 1.</li>
  <li>voteCount: a number of votes.</li>
  <li>totalVotes: total number of votes.</li>
  <li>All of these are non-negative real numbers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="preference-tallies">Preference Tallies</h3>

<p>Preference tallies tell how many votes have a listed preference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>voteCounts: a list of numbers of votes for a list of preferences.
    <ul>
      <li>Also used for “grid” of votes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>voteFractions: a list of fractions for a list of preferences. voteCounts as a fraction of the total number of votes.  From 0 to 1.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="candidate-tallies">Candidate Tallies</h3>

<p>Candidate tallies are just tallies indexed by candidate. This is a way to combine preferences. We have defined tallies for each type of preference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plurality
    <ul>
      <li>countByCan: The number of plurality votes for a candidate.</li>
      <li>voteFractionByCan: The fraction of plurality votes for a candidate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>score
    <ul>
      <li>scoreSumByCan: number of votes times score, summed for each candidate.</li>
      <li>scoreAverageByCan: average score for each candidate. = scoreSumByCan / totalVotes. number of votes times score divided by max score, summed for each candidate. (not used)</li>
      <li>scoreFractionAverageByCan: average fractional score for each candidate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ranking
    <ul>
      <li>bordaScoreSumByCan: sum of borda scores for a candidate.</li>
      <li>bordaFractionSumByCan: The sum of fractional borda scores for a candidate. (not used)</li>
      <li>bordaFractionAverageByCan: The average fractional borda score for a candidate.</li>
      <li>firstPreferences: a sum of ranking votes for each candidate, counting the vote only by the first preference.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Outside of voteCasters, we sometimes use a loosely defined tally. It changes its definition depending on the type of vote.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>tallyFractions: A general term that should only be used when we don’t need to know what type of vote was being used but instead just want to give each candidate a number between 0 and 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Uses of tallyFractions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>tooltip uses tallyFractions and ranking</li>
      <li>TestVoterGraphic uses tallyFractions</li>
      <li>A general representation of a vote as a vector.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pairwise-tallies">Pairwise Tallies</h3>

<p>Pairwise tallies are indexed by a pair of candidates. The winning candidate is first and the losing candidate is second. This is another way to combine preferences.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ranking
    <ul>
      <li>winsPairwise: The number of wins for the first of a pair of candidates.</li>
      <li>winFractionPairwise: The fraction of wins for the first of a pair of candidates.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="votes">Votes</h2>

<p>Some of the following object is output from a vote caster as the “votes” data structure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>preferencesLists:
    <ul>
      <li>scoreVotes - Each preference has a score for each candidate.</li>
      <li>rankings - Each preference has a rank for each candidate.</li>
      <li>cansByRankList - Each preference is a list indexed by ranking. A list of candidates is at each ranking.</li>
      <li>There is no “pluralityVotes” list of preferences because it isn’t needed. It would be an identity matrix.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>preferenceTallies:
    <ul>
      <li>voteFractions - the fraction of the voters who share the same preference.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>candidateTallies:
    <ul>
      <li>voteFractionsByCan - the fraction of plurality votes for each candidate.</li>
      <li>scoreFractionAverageByCan - the average fractional score for each candidate.</li>
      <li>firstPreferenceFractions - a list of fractions of voters who ranked a candidate first, indexed by candidate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>pairwiseTallies:
    <ul>
      <li>winFractionPairwise - the fraction of wins for the first of a pair of candidates.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>votesByGeom:
    <ul>
      <li>Vote data for each voter geometry. A list of votesForGeom.</li>
      <li>votesForGeom: Vote data for just one voter geometry. votesForGeom parts may include one of the following, depending on the vote caster:
        <ul>
          <li>votesForGeomCells: { ranking, cells }</li>
          <li>votesForGeomIntervals: { ranking, intervalBorders }</li>
          <li>votesForGeomGrid: { grid, voteSet, voterGeom }
            <ul>
              <li>This varies as well, depending on voteCaster.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>parties: { partiesByCan, numParties }</li>
  <li>numCans: the number of candidates</li>
</ul>

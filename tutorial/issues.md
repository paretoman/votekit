Here's a big list of things I want in the future.

* Parent Page: [index](index.md)

## Bugs

* Need to add more strategies when casting a vote. 
  * Perhaps judging on a universal scale is a strategy in some situation. 
  * Make a factor for compromise.
* Clicking on a tooltip over another screen doesn't work.

## UI

* Use React, or Vue, or something rather than custom buttons.

## Election Model

* Could use computational geometry to make line arrangment.
* Need to make districts predictable. At least for squares.
* Multi-phase elections.

## Visuals

* Animate +1 rising from candidate when they become winner.
* For multi-round methods, maybe also show comparisons between candidates in each round.
* We should not be using an object oriented approach like passing VoterViewList and CandidateViewList to a viz function. It's too confusing and it seems to cross the boundary between simulation model and visualization. We should instead pass data to a viz function.

## Documentation

* Add docs for strategies.

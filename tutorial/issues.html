        <p>Here’s a big list of things I want in the future.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parent Page: <a href="/votekit/tutorial/">index</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Need to add more strategies when casting a vote.
    <ul>
      <li>Perhaps judging on a universal scale is a strategy in some situation.</li>
      <li>Make a factor for compromise.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clicking on a tooltip over another screen doesn’t work.</li>
  <li>Handle zero candidate distribution, zero voters edge case for sampler.</li>
  <li>Needs labels.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ui">UI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use React, or Vue, or something rather than custom buttons.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="election-model">Election Model</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Could use computational geometry to make line arrangement.</li>
  <li>Need to make districts predictable. At least for squares.</li>
  <li>Multi-phase elections.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="visuals">Visuals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Animate +1 rising from candidate when they become winner.</li>
  <li>For multi-round methods, maybe also show comparisons between candidates in each round.</li>
  <li>We should not be using an object oriented approach like passing VoterViewList and CandidateViewList to a viz function. It’s too confusing and it seems to cross the boundary between simulation model and visualization. We should instead pass data to a viz function.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Add docs for strategies.</li>
</ul>

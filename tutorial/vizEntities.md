Other views call entity drawing functions, which are in vizEntities.

* Parent page: [viewScreens](viewScreens.md) 
* Child pages: [tooltips](tooltips.md)

## VizEntities

* Draws handles for voters and candidates.
* CircleGraphic makes a circle.
* SquareGraphic makes an animated square and shows stats.
* EntityGraphic translates entity positions in x and y between view and sim.
* [Tooltips](tooltips.md) are generated by clicks on an entity or a blank space.
* In the future, this should be simplified to only be responsible for the handles and setRenderer should be removed.

## VizCandidates

CandidateView has two components: a CandidateGraphic and a Candidate.

CandidateGraphic renders the square handle and clicks and draws data.

CandidateViewList mirrors CandidateList and adds management for CandidateGraphics.

## VizCandidateDns

Similar to VizCandidates except two additional components for rendering shapes.

CandidateDnRenderer renders the shape of CandidateDn.

CandidateDnRendererList mirrors CandidateDnList and adds rendering shapes.

## VizVoters

Has everything from VizCandidateDns

## VizTestVoters

* TestVoter: analogous to VoterShape
* TestVoterGraphic: analogous to VoterGraphic.
* TestVoterView has two componets: testVoter and TestVoterGraphic.

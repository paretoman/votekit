/**
 * This method has rounds.
 * Each round, the votes are weighted based on the previous round.
 * Weights start at 1.
 * Each round, the candidate with the highest weighted tally is selected.
 * Then the scores for the candidate are sorted.
 * The voters' weight is spent, starting from the top scores.
 * Weight is spent until the weight of voters included is equal to 1/seats, which is the quota.
 * @param {Object} votes - The object for vote data.
 * @param {Object[]} votes.scoreVotes - A list of votes
 * @param {Number[]} votes.scoreVotes[] - A score for each candidate. From 0 to 1.
 * @param {Object} votes.votePop - The fraction of the population that voted that way.
 * @param {Object} electionMethodOptions.seats - Number of candidates to elect.
 * @returns {{allocation:number[]}} - socialChoiceResults, with property allocation.
 * Allocation is an array of integers that say whether a candidate is elected (1) or not (0).

Here's a big list of things I want in the future.

## Bugs

* Architecture.md document needs to be updated to match code.
* Need to allow other strategies when casting vote. Perhaps judging on a universal scale is a strategy in some situation. Definitely need to consider polls.

## UI

* Use React, or Vue, or something rather than custom buttons.

## Election Model

* Gaussian voters

## Visuals

* Animate +1 rising from candidate when they become winner.
* Budget charts. For MES, show budget being spent in each round. Also, maybe also show comparisons between candidates in each round.

## Organizing Code

* Make test directory outside of src. maybe also put index.html there too, since that is the test I run when developing the code.

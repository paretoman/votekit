# Learning JSDoc
Documentation generator. Using JSDoc. 
To Install: 

    npm install -D jsdoc. 
    -D means --save-dev.

[Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK-GurROGIg) - First 8 minutes.

# Libraries
To get d3-delaunay as an importable module, I temporarily did an npm install d3-delaunay. Then I copied the code, removed the beginning and end parts that deal with npm exports, and renamed it d3-delaunay.esm.js. I did a similar thing with canvas2svg but I just downloaded it from github instead of using npm.

# Learning Parcel

had to install dependency with npm

    npm install d3-delaunay

To run a server:

    npx parcel .\src\pages\index.html


Couldn't import from https. So I 

    // import { Delaunay } from 'd3-delaunay'
    import { Delaunay } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/d3-delaunay@6'

It was difficult to get source maps working. My workaround was to remove inline javascript code from the html, which is probably good anyway. 

Here's an interesting sourcemap visualizer: https://parceljs.org/plugin-system/source-maps/#diagnosing-issues

Tried a few different build steps during deployment to netlify. Build-2 worked. It keeps relative paths. I set the publish directory on netlify to "dist".

    "build-1": "parcel build ./src/pages/*.html ./src/test/test.html --public-url ./",
    "build-2": "parcel build ./src/pages/*.html ./src/test/test.html --public-url ../",
    "build-3": "parcel build ./src/pages/*.html ./src/test/test.html"

# Codesandbox
I had to get the babel package "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties" to get the codesandbox to work. This required a few changes, like adding a .babelrc and adding @babel/core as well. I only use babel for this, and I don't yet use babel for transpiling from the command line.

A sandbox adds the Sim and View to a page. The addSandboxes script adds a sandbox to any element of the HTML page with class 'sandbox'.

* Parent page: [architecture](architecture.md) 

## Sandboxes

The whole program can be bundled into addSandboxes. Just add that script to your page. It will find HTML elements of class 'sandbox' and create a div for the sandbox next to the element.

A doubleSandbox provides two sandboxes that are linked.

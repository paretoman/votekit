/**
 * Run an Open List Proportional Representation method. Call this variant by the name "A".
 * Return a list of winning candidates and a list of allocated seats to parties.
 * A voter votes for a candidate. Party lists help candidates pool their votes.
 * Party lists are allocated seats. The most popular candidates in a party are elected.
 * @param {Object} votes
 * @param {number[]} votes.tallyFractions - tallies for each candidate as a fraction of 1.
 * @param {Object} electionMethodOptions
 * @param {number} electionMethodOptions.seats - The number of seats to fill.
 * @param {number} electionMethodOptions.threshold - The minimum fraction of voters
 * that a party needs to be eligible for a seat.
 * @returns {{allocation:number[]}} - A variable "socialChoiceResults",
 * with the property "allocation".
 * Allocation is an array of integers that say whether a candidate is elected (1) or not (0).

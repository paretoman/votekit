 * A SimVoter has functionality for a voter that is specific to a simulation.

 * This voter component is common to all simulations.
 * An example of a SimVoter is a GeoVoterBasis or a OneVoterCircle.
 * This is an inheritance structure.
 * @param {VoterCircle} voterCircle - a voter component that SimVoter builds upon.
 * @param {DraggableManager} dragm
